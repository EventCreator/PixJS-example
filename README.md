# pixi-examples

Repository for the pixi.js v3 examples, available online [here](githubioLink)

## Running

You can either clone the repository and download the zip file directly.

## Contributing

Ideally you will need to have [node][node] setup on your machine.

Then you can add a new example and build the manifest file :

```js
node generateManifest.js
```
Your local copy of the website should then be updated automatically.

[node]:       http://nodejs.org/
