Examples for using pixi.js v3

## Running

You will need to have [node][node] and [gulp][gulp] setup on your machine.

Then you can install dependencies and build:

```js
npm i && npm start
```

That will output the built distributables to `./dist`, and you can view the
examples at http://localhost:9000.
